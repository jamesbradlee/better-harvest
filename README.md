# Jameson's Better Harvest

Jameson's Better Harvest introduces a right click-to-harvest feature for various crops and plants in Minecraft,
enhancing the farming experience by allowing players to harvest crops without actually breaking them.

Credits to [Jam Core](https://modrinth.com/organization/jam-core) for the original idea - this mod is not a fork or copy
paste of their work, but rather an independent implementation inspired by their concept.
